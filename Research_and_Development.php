						 <p style="text-align:justify;">GSRF   is   a   research   organization,   well   known   for   conducting   application
oriented research aiming at problem solving and innovative solution.
Since   its   establishment   in   1978,   GSRF   has   been   actively   involved   in
undertaking research projects assigned by various Government Departments
and industrial organizations, private and public bodies  in the fields of oil and
oil-based   products,   animal   feed,   food   and   related   materials,   biofuels,   oil
substitutes etc. 
Research   was     conducted   on	  food   safety   and   nutrition,   micronutrient
enrichment of oils,     oil based products and common food items, detection
of   adulteration   and   contaminants,   utilization   of   indigenous   nontraditional
resources   to   increase   the   availability   of   food,   oil   and   animal   feed,
detoxification   of   nontraditional   oilcakes   for   utilization   as   animal   feed,
micronutrient enrichment and recovery of value-added by-products such as
wax,   lecithin,   vitamin	E,   oryzanol   and   fatty   acids,   from   the   vegetable   oil
refining   industry,   development   of   interesterified   fat   based   Vanaspati,
margarine etc.
The   Foundation   has   conducted   successfully   many   important   projects   on
behalf of the Directorate of Vanaspati, Oils and Fats, Ministry of Consumer
Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Government of India, CSIR, Ministry of
Food. Some project titles   are   Blending of Oils; Development of Soya Dal;
Recovery   of   Oil   from   Spent   Bleaching   Earth;   Preparation   of   Industrial​
Lipases;  Study on Shelf Life of RBD Palmolein; Study on the use of Mustard
Oil in Vanaspati;  Upscaling Inter-esterification	 Process to Pilot Plant Stage;
Preparation   of   Low   Trans-nutritious   Margarine   and   Shortening   Fat   Bases;
Development of Micro-Nutrient enriched High Performance Multiple Blended
Oil Mediums; Development of High Performance Oil Blends; Development Of
Medium Chain Triglycerides; Recovery, Upgrading, Modification  of  Lecithin
from Rice Bran Oil; Detection of Argemone Oil in Edible Oils; Scale Up Trial
of Partial Hydrogenation of Soybean Oil; Recovery of Useful Bye-products
Like Lecithin from  Indigenous  Non-traditional Oil  Sources;  Development  of
Salolein and Mahuaolein as Direct Cooking Oil Analogous to Palmolein etc
Department of Bio-technology, Government of India   identified GSRF as a
participant   in   a   multi-institutional   project   to   conduct   research   on
“Detoxification and Utilization of Key Agro-Forest Based Non Conventional
Oil   Cakes   in   the   Feeding   of   Livestock’.   In   addition,   the   Foundation   would
also   be   associating   in   another   DBT   financed   research   project   on   biotech
feed.
The   Foundation   has   served   the   nation   also   through   active   association   in
standardization   of   various   techniques   and   parameters   for   production   and
processing   as   well   as   in   standardizing   methods   of   testing   the   purity   and
adulterants   in   edible   products.   Alongwith,   the   Foundation   has   been
associated with private and public organizations in new product development
and diversification.​
The Foundation has, on behalf of the Bureau of Indian Standards and the
Central   Committee   on   Food   Standards,   established   and   standardized
methods .</p>
